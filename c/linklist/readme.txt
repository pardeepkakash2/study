Linklist:

1 Data Structures Write a program for reversing a singly linked list?
2 Write a program for a singly linked list (insert, delete, count, search etc functions).
3 Write a program for a doubly linked list (insert, delete, count, search etc functions).
4 Write a program for a circular singly linked list (insert, delete, count, search etc functions).
5 Write a program for a circular doubly linked list (insert, delete, count, search etc functions).
6 You are given a pointer to a node (not the tail node) in a singly linked list. Delete that node from the linked list. 
7 How to check whether a linked list is circular or not?
8 How would you find a loop in a singly linked list and remove the loop?
9 Write a c program for reversing a singly linked list.
10 Write a c program to get the intersection point of two singly linked lists.
11 Given two singly linked list, find if they are intersecting. Do this in single iteration. 
	Also find the intersecting node in O(n) time and O(1) space. By intersection I mean intersection by reference not by value.
