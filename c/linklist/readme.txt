Linklist:

1 Data Structures Write a program for reversing a singly linked list?
2 Write a program for a singly linked list (insert, delete, count, search etc functions).
3 Write a program for a doubly linked list (insert, delete, count, search etc functions).
4 Write a program for a circular singly linked list (insert, delete, count, search etc functions).
5 Write a program for a circular doubly linked list (insert, delete, count, search etc functions).
6 You are given a pointer to a node (not the tail node) in a singly linked list. Delete that node from the linked list. 
7 How to check whether a linked list is circular or not?
8 How would you find a loop in a singly linked list and remove the loop?
9 Write a c program for reversing a singly linked list.
10 Write a c program to get the intersection point of two singly linked lists.
11 Given two singly linked list, find if they are intersecting. Do this in single iteration. 
	Also find the intersecting node in O(n) time and O(1) space. By intersection I mean intersection by reference not by value.
12 implement Stack and Queue using Linked List
13 Repeatedly Delete N nodes after M nodes of a Linked list
14 Reverse every k nodes of a linked list
15 Reverse a Linked List using Recursion
16 Remove Duplicates from a Linked List
17 Print Linked List Elements in Reverse order
18 Merge a linked list into another linked list at alternate positions
19 Move last node to front in linked list
20 Swap every two nodes in a linked list
21 Frequency of a given number in a Linked List
22 Delete alternate nodes of a Linked List
23 Rotate linked list by K nodes
24 array vs linklist ?
